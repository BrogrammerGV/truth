<h4>Services offer attendees a chance to remember and honor their loved oneâ€™s life. These tributes are often an important step in the grieving process and can be tailored to celebrate the hobbies, passions and accomplishments of the deceased. 

You may plan a private service (a small gathering of close friends and family) or a public service (a gathering for friends, family and neighbors). Some families opt for both options.
