<h4>A viewing (sometimes called a wake, a visitation or calling hours), provides a less formal opportunity to offer condolences, share stories and grieve. 

Like services, viewings can be held publicly (a community viewing), privately (a family viewing) or both. 

Some viewings allow loved ones to view the deceased before burial or cremation, while others simply use it as a time to share memories and offer comfort.
