<h4>Deciding what will be done with your loved oneâ€™s remains is an important decision deeply influenced by personal preferences and religious beliefs. 

When you select burial, the remains are often placed in a casket and interred in a cemetery, mausoleum or crypt. With cremation, the remans are converted into ashes that can be shared, scattered or buried.
